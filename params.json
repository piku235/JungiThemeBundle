It provides wide features which allows you to create\r\nflexible and smart themes which have so-called tags. Thanks to these tags you can e.g. create a theme for desktop and mobile\r\ndevices (Responsive Web Design) or create two separate themes where each one is designed for another device (Adaptive Web\r\nDesign). Of course the functionality of the bundle not ends here.
