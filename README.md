JungiThemeBundle
================

The JungiThemeBundle is a themes engine designed for the Symfony2. It provides wide features which allows you to create
flexible and smart themes with so-called tags. Thanks to these tags you can e.g. create a theme for desktop and mobile
devices (Responsive Web Design) or create two separate themes where each one is designed for another device (Adaptive Web
Design). Of course the functionality of the bundle not ends here. Read the documentation to know more.
